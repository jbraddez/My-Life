        <p><span class="logo">My Life</span> is a website to keep your thoughts, feelings or anything. It's very much like a journal, you can write in it however often you choose, you can look back and see what was written when. All you need to do is write a message in the box and submit it. You can't delete any you have made and everything is stored locally.</p>
        <p>This website was made by <a href="https://jbraddez.github.io/">Jacob Bradley</a></p>
